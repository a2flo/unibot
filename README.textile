*UniBot*

UniBot is a small IRC bot written in C++11 with support for lua scripting.

For built-in/example scripts look through the "scripts/" folder, documentation can be found in "doc/lua_bindings.html".

The configuration file (etc/unibot.conf) must reside in the system "/etc" folder.
You can also specify the config location relative from the "/etc" folder when starting the bot: "$ unibot somefolder/unibot.conf".

* run ./premake.sh
* make

on OS X:
